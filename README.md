# MatterJS-Slingshot-Game
A simple slingshot game created with the MatterJS library. Also includes CRUD to
a local server created using Ruby on Rails! The frontend site itself has the slingshot
game available to play with, but in order to see users and comments, this server
(https://github.com/BWitz/MatterJS-Slingshot-RailsAPI) must be run on local port 3000.
